Internship Tasks - In this project, I developed a model to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, helping users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. Utilizing the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), I built a system that involves:
Food Item Classification,Estimation,Data Handling. I employed Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to manage image data, train the model, and achieve reliable food recognition and calorie estimation. This project enhanced my expertise in image classification and practical applications in dietary tracking and nutrition.
